Engines - 
Chrome : V8 Engine
Firefox has SpiderMonkey
Safari has JavaScriptCore (also called Nitro)
Edge has Chakra

Advantages of Node js.
1) to be used for data insentive application
2) open source, Async, single threaded, fast, no waiting 
3) resource are used less...
4) process request via event loop machanism
5)


NPM 
1) node package manager
2) host of packages / libraries
3) core modules installed when installing node js
4) 


Javascript Compilation - 
Compilation
JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they compile it.
This has been happening since 2009, when the SpiderMonkey JavaScript compiler was added to Firefox 3.5, and everyone followed this idea.
JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.
This might seem counter-intuitive, but since the introduction of Google Maps in 2004, JavaScript has evolved from a language that was generally executing a few dozens of lines of code to complete applications with thousands to hundreds of thousands of lines running in the browser.
Our applications now can run for hours inside a browser, rather than being just a few form validation rules or simple scripts.
In this new world, compiling JavaScript makes perfect sense because while it might take a little bit more to have the JavaScript ready, once done it's going to be much more performant than purely interpreted code.


REPL :
REPL also known as Read Evaluate Print Loop is a programming language environment(Basically a console window) that takes single expression as user input and returns the result back to the console after execution.

The _ special variable
If after some code you type _, that is going to print the result of the last operation.



Node.js, accept arguments from the command line

You can pass any number of arguments when invoking a Node.js application using
node app.js
Arguments can be standalone or have a key and a value.
For example:
node app.js joe
or
node app.js name=joe

This changes how you will retrieve this value in the Node.js code.
The way you retrieve it is using the process object built into Node.js.
It exposes an argv property, which is an array that contains all the command line invocation arguments.

The first element is the full path of the node command.
The second element is the full path of the file being executed.
All the additional arguments are present from the third position going forward.

Node js File system & funtion ?

Create server in Node.js
 
 
 Event in Node js.
 
 Two method to remember emit() & on()
 
 EventEmitter.on() // Event Listener
 EventEmitter.emit() // Event Trigger
 
 
 Express.js
 
 
 We need to understand the need for AMD and what differentiates it from CommonJS.
